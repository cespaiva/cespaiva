### Hi Peep's from Git HUB 👋

On GitHub i am **cespaiva**

Actually, my real name is *César Augusto Guarido de Paiva*;

📝 I have a Bachelor's degree in Nutrition; former Classic Physique bodybuilder.

 📫 You can reach me via @guarido.nutri, that's my IG! however i am looking to start my LinkedIn profile.

⚡ As a former Nutritionist i'v got alot of experiences into making my clients achieve a better lifestyle and even competed in Bodybuilding myself
however i'v really got interested in the world of Web Dev's since my GF is a Software Engineer!

 👽️When i was a kid i was hooked onto MMORPG's like Ragnarok, Everquest, Tibia, World of Warcraft, Perfect World, Silkroad
... oh man, i could list pretty much all MMO's from the top100 *(if youknow you know)* did some basic courses from software to hardware but didnt get commit to keep going, instead i changed to the "fitness" way hah.


🌱 At the moment i'm praticing my hardskills, i mean, kinda of praticing since i still dedicate alot of time to my former job, tbh i really got 
hooked into the digital world and want to learn more about it but on my own pace, since i still LOVE what i do and its my passion.

🔧👷🧱 I'm looking foward to make some cool projects and even contribute if anyone wants! i mean, thats always something to learn out there *RIGHT?* 🔧👷🧱
